# 🎮 RiftLink

**RiftLink** is a social platform designed for gamers to connect, communicate, and coordinate across shared interest spaces called _realms_. Built on **Rails 8** with a future-facing goal of **decentralization**, RiftLink aims to empower player communities with flexible tools for messaging, events, and identity.
